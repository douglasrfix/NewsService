This will be informal ramblings about the project until they,
 the ramblings, are moved to a better home.

Consider these as captured stream of conscious musings.

1. What is a news service anyway? At the moment, it is the publisher role
. This implies transmission of content, not necessarily creation of content
. This may be packaging of content from creators and advertisers.  It would
 mean revenue creation via subscribers and/or advertisers. It would mean
  paying the content providers.  Dealing with syndicators. 
  
2. This started out as a project to replace the one man local newspaper. It
  needs an text editor, non text media manager. Storage space and
   distribution capability to a set of subscribers. It would be nice to be
    able to generate voice from the text as well.
    
3. How to handle security. How do I know who sent/created the content?

4.Resource utilization.
- Assume that the process will omly take notice of pubsub messages exchanged between nodes. It will only request data from the network upon request. Only the consumer can cause transmission of data. There is no platform that must be managed and requested permission of. No local strage is consumed by content unless the user wishes to see/hear/see it.
5. Freedom of speech.
- In a freedom of speech context, You can speak all you want to but you can't make anyone listen. The trick will be to sort out the wheat from the chaff. As a first cut I would imagine that a content flag will identify at a minimum porn or not porn. No flag the application will not retrieve it. Thia won't stop it from being published but the user can avoid the content. This would apply as well to unlawful contantas well. A provider of such content would be put on a black list and the provider would be banned from the application and the would not have the contnet propagted. I envision that a credability score might be developed for each provider.
6. This is not intended to satisfy the streaming/eye candy crowd.
- By it's nature, a request must initiate the process and your network may not provide sufficient resources to stisfy streaming. You would normaly "downlaod" before viewing the content.
- I would start with a summary description that would provide simple topic and summary to dtermine if the content appears interestinh. No video grabs or other animated foolishness, This could be fetched automatically by user preference for subscribed channels/topics/? etc.
