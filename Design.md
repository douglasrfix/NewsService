The actual message will be an IPNS name that identifies the head of a linked list of content descriptions.

Pubsub messages may be delivered out of order but the order for the author is provided by the seqno.

The first implementation will use a singal topic "IGNS". (Intra Galactic News Source. Wouldn't want to be over ambitious.)

The PeerID of the auther of a message will be the "Channel".

Legal Free Speech prevails.  Truth in labeling is required.

All access of content is voluntary and without recourse to the publisher. If you don't like it, don't access it.
